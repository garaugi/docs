##  Server installation errors

### RHEL 8

While installing the PEM server on RHEL 8, if you see this error:

```text
[root@etpgxlt firstuser]# dnf install edb-pem
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
Last metadata expiration check: 0:01:33 ago on Wed 30 Mar 2022 01:28:16 AM EDT.
Error: 
 Problem: problem with installed package python3-mod_wsgi-4.6.4-4.el8.s390x
  - package python39-mod_wsgi-4.7.1-4.module+el8.4.0+9822+20bf1249.s390x conflicts with python3-mod_wsgi provided by python3-mod_wsgi-4.6.4-4.el8.s390x

  - package edb-pem-8.4.0-7.rhel8.s390x requires edb-pem-server = 8.4.0-7.rhel8, but none of the providers can be installed
  - cannot install the best candidate for the job
(try to add '--allowerasing' to command line to replace conflicting packages or '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages or '--nobest' to use not only best candidate packages)
[root@etpgxlt firstuser]# 
```

Remove the `python3-mod_wsgi` package first:

```shell
dnf remove python3-mod_wsgi
```

Try installing the PEM server again.

### RHEL 7 ppc64le

After installing the PEM server on RHEL 7 ppc64le, you may see the following cipher error in the worker log file:

```text
WARNING: ConnectToPEM: unable to connect to PEM database: could not create SSL context: library has no ciphers
```

To resolve this error, if you intend to stay on PostgreSQL version 12, upgrade to the latest available version. Then, restart the PEM agent.

## Reconfiguring the PEM server

In some situations, you might need to uninstall the PEM server, reinstall it, and then configure the server again. To do so:

1.  Remove the PEM server configuration and uninstall:

    ```shell
    /usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh â€“un
    ```

2.  Remove the PEM packages:

    ```shell
    yum erase edb-pem-server
    ```

3.  Drop the `pem` database:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE pem
    ```

4.  Move the certificates from `/root/.pem/` to another location:

    ```shell
    mv /root/.pem/* <new_location>
    ```

5.  Move the `agent.cfg` file from `/usr/edb/pem/agent/etc/agent.cfg` to another location:

    ```shell
    mv /usr/edb/pem/agent/etc/agent.cfg <new_location>
    ```

6.  Then, configure the PEM server again:

    ```shell
    /usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh
    ```

## Error connecting to PostgreSQL server

When connecting to a PostgreSQL server, you may get an error message. If you encounter an error message, please review the message carefully; each error message attempts to incorporate the information you'll need to resolve the problem. For more details about specific errors, please locate the error message in the list below:

- **Connection to the server has been lost**: This error message indicates that the connection attempt has taken longer than the specified threshold; there may be a problem with the connection properties provided on the `Server` dialog, network connectivity issues, or the server may not be running.

- **Could not connect to Server: Connection refused**: If PEM displays this message, there are two possible reasons for this:  

    -   the database server isn't running - simply start it.
    -   the server isn't configured to accept TCP/IP requests on the address shown.

    For security reasons, a PostgreSQL server "out of the box" doesn't listen on TCP/IP ports. Instead, it must be enabled to listen for TCP/IP requests. This can be done by adding **tcpip = true** to the postgresql.conf file for Versions 7.3.x and 7.4.x, or **listen_addresses='\*'** for Version 8.0.x and above; this will make the server accept connections on any IP interface.

    For further information, please refer to the PostgreSQL documentation about [runtime configuration](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/runtime-config.html).

- **FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry**: If PEM displays this message when connecting, your server can be contacted correctly over the network, but is not configured to accept your connection. Your client has not been detected as a legal user for the database.

    To connect to a server, the pg_hba.conf file on the database server must be configured to accept connections from the host of the PEM client. Modify the pg_hba.conf file on the database server host, and add an entry in the form:

    > -   **host template1 postgres 192.168.0.0/24 md5** for an IPV4 network
    > -   **host template1 postgres ::ffff:192.168.0.0/120 md5** for an IPV6 network

    For more information, please refer to the PostgreSQL documentation about [client authentication](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/client-authentication.html).

- **FATAL: password authentication failed**: The `password authentication failed for user` error message indicates there may be a problem with the password you entered. Retry the password to confirm you entered it correctly. If the error message returns, make sure that you have the correct password, that you are authorized to access the server, and that the access has been correctly configured in the server's postgresql.conf configuration file.
